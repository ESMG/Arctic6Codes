# setup

This directory contains setup codes for the Arctic6 model run.

## forcing

NOTE: The atmospheric forcing fields were developed using the Arctic18
model run.  The forcing fields should be interchangable across any of the
Arctic runs.  See `mid_12/setup/forcing` for the codes that create the
atmospheric forcing fields.
